	<p>The Haslemere Musical Society was founded in 1923 and gave annual concerts up until 1939. Since
	then it has performed two or more concerts a year of classical works, and it now has a considerable
	following.</p>

	<p>The H.M.S. is one of comparatively few societies to have both an orchestra and a choir. Programmes
	have included choral works such as The Dream of Gerontius, Messiah and Creation, and the symphonies
	of Brahms, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky; together with a variety of shorter and more modern works. We
	have commissioned a number of new works namely, Lord of all Creation, Darrell Davison, Hail O Sun
	of Righteousness, William Godfree and Festival Cantata, Clive Osgood. Recently the Orchestra was
	recorded performing the background music for a film The Long Journey Home, composed by Phillip
	Sheppard.</p>

	<p>Both choir and orchestra rehearse on a Monday evening at 19:30 in the Haslemere Hall, between
	September and May.</p>

	<p>The orchestra usually meets for a number of summer sessions as well, working with invited
	conductors. (More details)</p>
