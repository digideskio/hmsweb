<p>Singers and instrumentalists interested in joining the society are very welcome to attend a
rehearsal. Membership is then by mutual agreement with the music director / chorus master.
Auditions are required for wind and brass vacancies.</p>

<p>In the Spring, a Come and Sing event is held in St Christophers Church, Weyhill, where a	choral
work is studied under a guest conductor. This is then performed to an audience	of friends and
family. The Come and Sing is open to all. There is a charge of &pound;13 (HMS	members &pound;10) to cover music
hire, accompanist, venue and refreshments. The Society	welcomes singers who are not currently
members of the Society. The orchestra will join	the chorus for the final run through.</p>
