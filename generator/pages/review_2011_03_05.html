<h2>Haslemere's Brahms Requiem and Clive Osgood world premiere</h2>

<p>The Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus are known for presenting enterprising programmes,
but few could have been more adventurous than their spring concert held on Saturday 5th March, to a
capacity audience in the Haslemere Hall.</p>

<p>It began with a rousing performance of Shostakovitch’s Festival Overture which was marked by
sharp rhythms and a wonderfully big tune from the strings.</p>

<p>As conductor James Ross explained, Schubert may never have intended to ‘finish’ his Unfinished
Symphony, notwithstanding the attempts of others to do so. Schubert’s existing score received a
well-rounded performance, with some lovely solo contributions from the wind instruments and
thrilling build-ups to the great climaxes, even if the string tone could have been a bit more
generous in the soaring melodies of this great composer of songs.</p>

<p>It was then the turn of local organist and Society accompanist Clive Osgood to display his
talent as a composer. His Festival Cantata, a setting of the Anglican canticles Te Deum and
Jubilate Deo, is unashamedly popular in idiom, built over an insistent repeated motif, with strong
choral lines which could have been projected more joyfully. This was, after all, a world premiÇre.
The orchestral parts were complex, and very well managed, even if there could have been more of a
crescendo in the central instrumental movement.</p>

<p>And so to Brahms’s evocative German Requiem, the composer’s masterly setting of vernacular
Biblical texts reflecting the human predicament. This demanding work received a very creditable,
indeed moving, performance. The choir had been well schooled in their German pronunciation, and the
performance was beautifully shaped by conductor James Ross, with plenty of light and shade. Good
bold choral lines were the order of the day (despite one tentative entry from the altos), and
Rebecca Moon and Jon Stainsby proved excellent soloists.</p>
