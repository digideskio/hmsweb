		<h2>Haslemere Symphony Orchestra - A triumphant Elijah</h2>

		<p>Mendelssohn's Elijah was first performed in Birmingham in 1846. It was an instant success
		and has been in the choral repertory in this Country ever since. Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and
		chorus gave a spirited performance at Haslemere Hall on Saturday 2nd March and gave much enjoyment
		to a large audience.</p>

		<p>The superb choruses, whilst not approaching the majesty of the St Matthew Passion or Haydn's
		Creation nonetheless lift the heart and are, for most, not to be dismissed as mere sentimentality.
		With occasional lapses of ensemble, the orchestra was very well conducted by James Ross who brought
		the best out of the choir and the orchestra. "Woe to him, let the guilty Prophet perish", a
		somewhat operatic number, was particularly effective as was the more well-known "Be not afraid".
		The soloists were all of high quality particularly John Stainsby whose command of the part of
		Elijah was outstanding. His impeccable intonation and clear diction made this a memorable
		performance and he was well supported by the other soloists, Arthur Swan, a fine tenor, Sara
		Wallender Ross, who sang her solos with great sensitivity, and Cathy Bell,the mezzo contralto whose
		performance of the justly famous "O rest in the Lord" was touching and admirable.</p>

		<p>The best music is to be found in Part 2 where Elijah's frustration at his backsliding compatriots,
		urged on by Jezabel, create a musical and dramatic tension which is more effective than the contest
		with the priests of Baal in Part 1. The final choruses inspired the Orchestra, Choir and soloists
		to bring this excellent performance to a rousing finale.</p>

		<p>Elijah has its longeurs; it is patchy but it also has undoubted strengths drawing on classical
		tradition - Lutheran chorales, the great works of Bach, who was so admired by Mendelssohn, and
		Haydn's Creation --. Mendelssohn, although baptised as a Lutheran at the age of seven, wanted it to
		be true to its Old Testament biblical roots and viewed in this way, it succeeds without the need
		for sentimentality of which it is sometimes accused. At the end of his life, Mendelssohn, a superb
		craftsman, produced a work which fully justifies its enduring reputation. We salute the HSO and
		Chorus and all the soloists for a thoroughly enjoyable performance.</p>
