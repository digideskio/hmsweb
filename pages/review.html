		<h2>Haslemere Symphony Orchestra excels in ambitious summer programme</h2>

		<p>Notwithstanding the winter temperatures outside, a warm glow suffused the Haslemere Hall last
		Saturday when the Musical Society presented their summer programme. It was apparent from the outset
		that this chorus and orchestra have come on by leaps and bounds. That outset was the striking
		opening of Holst's Festival Te Deum, full of Dorian inflexions and whirling string sounds which
		sounded magnificent.</p>

		<p>It was followed by a remarkably bold and original Kyrie from the twenty-five-year-old Mozart,
		the kind of piece which made one regret that he never completed the Mass setting. It received a
		bold and confident performance from the chorus and the prominent wind parts in the orchestra were
		excellent.</p>

		<p>The orchestra, under its conductor James Ross, was on its own for the next item, four movements
		from Grieg's Peer Gynt. These were shot through with drama, from the scurrying opening of the
		abduction scene, through the evocative Morning and the lonely death scene, to a truly impressive
		and sinister depiction of the Hall of the Mountain King.</p>

		<p>The most unusual item of this very enterprising concert was the Fantasia for Soprano Saxophone
		and orchestra by Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos. Full of snappy rhythms and soulful melodies, this
		found saxophone soloist David Wigram at his scintillating best, as he responded to the many moods
		with an exquisite tone and sensitive rapport with the orchestra. This young man will go far.</p>

		<p>Henry Wood's guest Rachmaninov was profoundly moved by the premiAÌˆre of Vaughan Williams's
		Serenade to Music and the Haslemere performance of this glorious setting of Shakespeare's words was
		indeed moving. The warm, full choral sound and the beautifully phrased orchestral accompaniment
		were enhanced by the contribution of five soloists singing from within the choir to great effect.
		Soprano Susanna Hogan was particularly impressive.</p>

		<p>The sinister mood so effectively evoked in the Grieg re-appeared in Mussorgsky's wonderfully
		descriptive Night on a Bare Mountain. Wind, brass, percussion and strings all contributed
		magnificently to this colourful depiction of a Witches' Sabbath and James Ross drove his forces on
		with demonic ardour.</p>

		<p>Finally chorus and orchestra gave a vivacious and beautifully articulated account of Haydn's
		great Te Deum.</p>
