	<p>As we come to the end of our 2012-2013 season, so it's a good time to
	reflect on the year that has gone and that which is ahead of us.</p>

	<p>In October 2012 we had a wonderful Orchestral concert in St Christopher's
	church with Mozart's overture to Don Giovanni, the Delius Song before
	Sunrise and Schubert's Symphony No 6. The highlight of the evening was
	Helen Owlett's beautiful clarinet playing in Weber's Clarinet Concerto
	and Finzi's Five Bagatelles. </p>

	<p>We are indeed fortunate to have such talent in our Orchestra. The December
	concert was a sell out for The Messiah (excerpts) and Beethoven's Symphony
	No 6, the Pastoral. Both were enthusiastically received by the large audience.
	In February we had a hugely successful Come and Sing in St Christopher's
	Church when Christopher Hann, our new Chorus Master, rehearsed a choir of over
	100 in Faur&eacute;s Requiem with Clive Osgood on the organ. </p>

	<p>We were then joined by a small orchestra (mostly HMS members) for the
	performance which added much to the pleasure of the event for all present.
	Christopher has been a great success in everything he has done with us
	throughout his first season with us. </p>

	<p>The performance of Mendelssohn's Elijah in March was outstanding. Orchestra
	and Chorus were at their best on the night and the soloists were superb. Thanks
	to the sterling efforts of members of the Society in publicising the concert
	and selling tickets we had a near full house with only a few unsold seats
	downstairs.</p>

	<h3>Welwyn Garden City in March</h3>

	<p>When the trip to Welwyn Garden City Music Society to perform Elijah on 23rd
	March with its Orchestra and Chorus was suggested, no-one considered the
	weather would be so dreadful. On the morning of the trip some members were
	frightened off by snow and ice. Others were suffering from recurring winter
	coughs and colds. With the help of a determined driver and comfortable coach 20
	members got to St John's Church, Digswell and were given a warm welcome by
	the WGC Orchestra and Chorus.</p>

	<p>Everyone who braved the journey and the long day of rehearsal and performance
	agreed it was an amazing day: the different venue, joining with another choir
	and orchestra and the opportunity to sing again a great work which the Society
	had performed earlier in the month made it a really worthwhile experience.</p>

	<p>The photo gives some idea of the weather, the style of the Church and the
	layout for the concert. </p>

	<h3>Highlights of 2011/2012</h3>

	<p>Membership increased by 1 to 83. We again gave an orchestral
		concert in St Christopher's Church, Haslemere in October and
		three orchestral and choral concerts in the Haslemere Hall,
		in December, March and May, all of which were well
		received.</p>

	<p>For the orchestral concert the church was full and the
		December concert was near capacity. The October programme
		consisted of Beethoven's "Coriolan" overture, the Cello
		Concerto No 1 by Saint-Saens in which <strong>Anna Hunt</strong>,
		the leader of our cello section, was the soloist, and Haydn's
		Symphony No 104.</p>

	<p>In December we performed Schumann's Symphony no.3 Rhenish
		and Mozart's Requiem. In March the programme included
		Mendelssohn's "Hebrides" Overture, the Symphony no.3 of
		Sibelius, and Elgar's choral work "The Music Makers". </p>

	<p>The May concert, on a Spanish theme, consisted of the Ballet
		Music from "Le Cid" by Massenet, two items by De Falla,
		"Danse Espagnole" from "La Vida Breve" and Suite no.1 from
		"The Three-cornered Hat", and scenes from Bizet's opera
		"Carmen". </p>

	<p>In January the orchestra recorded the music for the
		soundtrack of a locally-produced film "The Long Journey
		Home" which was nominated for an award at the
		Aesthetica Short Film Festival and in May the orchestra
		played at the Mayor of Haslemere's reception. </p>

<div class="content_col_lhs">
	<p>We held a successful "<b>Come and Sing</b>" day in February
	in St Christopher's Church when the work rehearsed and
	performed was the choral suite from "The Armed Man" by Karl
	Jenkins. </p>

	<p>In June members and visitors enjoyed four open summer
	sessions, two for orchestra and two for chorus and
	orchestra, when a variety of music was played through under
	guest conductors. </p>

	<p>During the year we enabled students of the University of
	Surrey and the University of Creative Arts to make
	recordings of the orchestra as part of their study courses.</p>

	<p>Our new Chorus Master, Christopher Hann joined us for the beginning
	of the 2013 season.</p>
