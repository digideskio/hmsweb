	<h2>News - Highlights of 2011/2012</h2>

	<p>Membership increased by 1 to 83. We again gave an orchestral
		concert in St Christopher's Church, Haslemere in October and
		three orchestral and choral concerts in the Haslemere Hall,
		in December, March and May, all of which were well
		received.</p>

	<p>For the orchestral concert the church was full and the
		December concert was near capacity. The October programme
		consisted of Beethoven's Coriolan overture, the Cello
		Concerto No 1 by Saint-Saens in which <strong>Anna Hunt</strong>,
		the leader of our cello section, was the soloist, and Haydn's
		Symphony No 104.</p>

	<p>In December we performed Schumann's Symphony no.3 ("Rhenish")
		and Mozart's Requiem. In March the programme included
		Mendelssohn's "Hebrides" Overture, the Symphony no.3 of
		Sibelius, and Elgar's choral work "The Music Makers". </p>

	<p>The May concert, on a Spanish theme, consisted of the Ballet
		Music from "Le Cid" by Massenet, two items by De Falla,
		"Danse Espagnole" from "La Vida Breve" and Suite no.1 from
		"The Three-cornered Hat", and scenes from Bizet's opera
		"Carmen". </p>

	<p>In January the orchestra recorded the music for the
		soundtrack of a locally-produced film "The Long Journey
		Home" which was nominated for an award at the
		Aesthetica Short Film Festival and in May the orchestra
		played at the Mayor of Haslemere's reception. </p>

	<p>We held a successful "<b>Come and Sing</b>" day in February
		in St Christopher's Church when the work rehearsed and
		performed was the choral suite from "The Armed Man" by Karl
		Jenkins. </p>

	<p>In June members and visitors enjoyed four open summer
		sessions, two for orchestra and two for chorus and
		orchestra, when a variety of music was played through under
		guest conductors. </p>

	<p>During the year we enabled students of the University of
		Surrey and the University of Creative Arts to make
		recordings of the orchestra as part of their study courses.</p>

	<p>	Our Chorus Master Michael Veazey left us after the May concert
		and has been replaced by Christopher Hann for the 2013 season.</p>
