		<h2>March 8 Concert: Brief Report</h2>

		<p>The HMS concert on 8 March 2014 proved a tour de force for both choir and orchestra. It is a curious fact that, for a society over 90 years old, the occasion was almost a coming of age. The orchestra, probably better than it has ever been, gave a moving and intensely rich performance of Dvorak&#39;s 6th symphony.</p>
<p>The choir, who had wrestled for two months with a difficult Bruckner Mass and had occasionally wondered whether it would ever work, ended the evening to rapturous applause, feeling that this evening, more than anything in their recent past, had defined them as entirely worthy of the faithful audiences who come out, year after year, to hear them perform.</p>
<p>As a society, choir and orchestra together, they are on a high which should long sustain them as they head to their centenary. </p>

		<h2>Conductor James Ross on why he likes to be at the helm of HMS.</h2>

		<p>FROM small beginnings in 1923, Haslemere Musical Society (HMS) is now both a force to be reckoned with and something of a rarity.</p>
<p>The society is unusual in that it is one of the very few across the UK to have both an orchestra and a choir. It is also very fortunate to have Dr James Ross, an inspirational and high-profile British conductor as its musical director.</p>
<p>Fresh from the success of a sell-out &#x2018;Come and Sing' concert at St Christopher's Church in Haslemere, orchestra and choir are now gearing up for their next big challenge, They will play Dvo&#x159;&aacute;k's Symphony No. 6 and sing Bruckner's very moving Mass No. 1 in D Minor during a joint concert in Haslemere Hall, on March 8.</p>
<p>HMS choir members were joined by more than 100 singers from many different choirs and supported by around 40 members of the society's symphony orchestra augmented by other local players for rehearsals on Saturday, under the baton of HMS professional chorus master Christopher Hann. The highlight of the evening concert was the massed rendition of Handel's coronation anthem Zadok the Priest and an impromptu performance of Parry's Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Ross, the society's internationally acclaimed conductor, has been at the helm for more than six years and he is impressed by what HMS has to offer. &#x201c;There are a only a very small number of comparable amateur organisations in the UK,&#x201d; he told The Herald. &#x201c;Mainly they have either a chorus or an orchestra but not both. It's very rare and it brings huge advantages. &#x201c;They can both rehearse in different parts of Haslemere Hall and come together as one unit. &#x201c;Most choral societies have an orchestra that turns up on the day and they have one rehearsal beforehand. HMS has the luxury of working together to build a performance. &#x201c;Without amateur musicians, such as those in HMS, and the dedicated music lovers that come to hear them, there would be no professional music industry. &#x201c;I am an adviser to major record companies and major players in the music industry, and it is really evident what an important dynamic the amateur sector is. &#x201c;The UK is the world's largest market after the US and Japan by a big margin. &#x201c;I'm convinced one of the reasons why it's so disproportionately high in the UK is the active participation by an abnormally high number of people in music compared to almost any other country. Organisations like HMS function largely without state support and their social impact and importance to the community and the country is too often underestimated.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Mr Ross and HMS's three other professionals - chorus master Christopher Hann, Tom Horn, orchestra leader and assistant conductor, and Clive Osgood, rehearsal pianist and deputy chorus master - all play an &#x201c;extremely important and valuable role in its success&#x201d;, he added. </p>
