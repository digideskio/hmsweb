	<h3>Latest Reviews</h3>

	<p><strong>Review of Haslemere Musical Society Concert May 4, 2013 </strong></p>
	<p>Haslemere Hall was the site of a celebration of local talent and enthusiasm on
	Saturday night (May 4) as the orchestra and chorus of the Haslemere Musical
	Society  gathered for a concert in their 90th anniversary season. Wearing
	colourful blouses and bow ties, the chorus set an appropriately festive tone
	for the spring-themed concert, which featured The Villagers' Chorus from
	Rossini's 'William Tell', Anvil Chorus from Verdi's 'Il
	Trovatore' and Procession and Chorale from Wagner's 'The
	Mastersingers of Nuremberg', among many other delights...



	<p>The last of the sun's rays was still filtering into the hall as the
	orchestra commanded our attention with Rossini's 'The Barber of
	Seville' Overture. Under James Ross' energetic and very physical
	direction, the orchestra began strongly and continued to gain confidence and
	energy throughout the evening.  The chorus, too, rose to the not insignificant
	challenge of meeting the orchestra's energy and sound. While at times the
	chorus of happy villagers and wedding guests seemed somewhat underwhelmed, the
	whole of the evening was sung capably and was a tribute to the passions and
	talents of all the musicians involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="img_col_rhs">
	<img src="images/reviews/joannaAndAnthony.png" alt="Joanna Bywater and HMS president Sir Anthony Laughton" />
</div>
<div class="content_col_lhs">
	<p>A particular treat were the arias sung by St Edmund's School (Hindhead)
	choristers Tallulah Horton, Sam Dashwood and Louis Denison-Foster.  Each showed
	remarkable vocal skill, and their poise and professionalism on stage were made
	more astounding by the revelation that none had ever sung with a full orchestra
	until the performance itself. It will be a pleasure to see these young singers
	continue to develop their talents in the coming years.</p>

	 
	<p>Soprano soloist Joanna Bywater's radiant delivery of Mascagni's Easter
	Hymn proved to be one of the evening's highlights. Her performance was so
	captivating that even director James Ross lost his cool. Having reassured the
	audience during the 'William Tell' selection that no arrows would be
	shot during the performance, Ross surprised everyone (including himself) by
	sending his baton soaring into the stalls during the climactic moment.</p>

	 
	<p>On such a lovely spring evening, it was good to hear the Haslemere Musical
	Society bringing off a lighter repertoire as effectively as the weightier
	oratorios we have heard recently. I look forward to future concerts with great
	anticipation.</p>

	<p><strong>HMS at the Proms in the Park - Saturday 11th May 2013</strong></p>

	<p>There was plenty of pre-event excitement leading up to the Proms in
	the Park on Lion Green on Saturday 11th May at the start of the Haslemere
	Festival 2013.  It was impossible to escape being given a Festival programme
	which said that this was to be Haslemere's own version of the Last Night of
	the Proms.  The 50 strong orchestra and the massed choirs of nearly 200 voices
	rehearsed in the afternoon competing with the screams from those enjoying the
	Big Wheel and the various stalls selling food and drink.  Why not bring your
	own picnic and dine out Glyndebourne style, the programme said. </p>

	<p>Of course, this is England and the inevitable happened.  The rain came down and
	only the stalwart set up their picnics under their umbrellas.  Even so the
	atmosphere was wonderful and all praise to those who played their instruments
	under the corrugated iron roof which accentuated the noise of the rain and to
	the singers from various schools and choirs who kept going despite the ever
	decreasing temperature.  The Haslemere Musical Society was well represented.
	Half the orchestra was made up of HMS members and a number of HMS choir members
	sang with the Festival Choir. </p>

	<p>Handel's Music for Royal Fireworks was enhanced by a tremendous
	firework display and the evening ended with sufficiently loud bangs and
	brilliant colours to ensure everyone in the neighbourhood knew the Festival had
	truly begun.</p>
