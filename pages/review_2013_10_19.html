		<h2>Haslemere Musical Society launch season with impressive orchestral concert</h2>
		<h3>St Christopher’s Church, Wey Hill, Haslemere, 19th October 2013</h3>

		<p>The Haslemere Musical Society, forever ambitious and resourceful, opened their
		season on  Saturday 19th October when the Haslemere Symphony Orchestra
		performed to a packed St Christopher’s Church.</p>

		<p>These purely amateur musicians perform because they love doing so, and there
		are no auditions as members can soon discern whether they are up to standard.
		And up to standard they certainly were in ambitious works by the French
		composers Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel. Known mainly for the famous
		Sicilienne, performed by flautists the world over, Fauré’s suite taken from his
		incidental music for Maeterlinck’s play Pélleas et Mélisande contains much
		haunting music reflecting the tragic nature of the drama. In this the oboe is
		prominent, and David Farnworth contributed brilliantly, partnered by some
		excellent flute, clarinet, and horn playing. The warm acoustics of the church
		gave the strings a wonderfully warm sound, which was also brought to bear in
		the following work. This was Maurice Ravel’s Le Tombeau de Couperin,  a tribute
		not only to eighteenth-century musicians and musical life, but to the
		composer’s friends killed in the First World War. Antique dances are given a
		piquant twist here, with much imaginative orchestration, and the strings
		excelled themselves in the final Rigaudon. But in other places, such as the
		dissonant Forlane we could have wished for a little more flow and a little less
		stiltedness from the interpretation of conductor James Ross.</p>

		<p>Johannes Brahms’s D major Serenade is the work of a young man (not the stolid
		bearded figure of later years) still mourning his mentor Robert Schumann and
		not yet daring to emulate his hero Beethoven by writing a symphony (that was to
		come some fifteen years later). But the serenade, albeit modelled on Mozart’s
		Posthorn Serenade, is symphonic in many ways, and in places sinks to tremendous
		emotional depths. Roger Doulton opened splendidly on the French horn, and
		indeed contributed wonderfully to the whole performance. There were glorious
		choirs of wind instruments and some lovely string playing.</p>
