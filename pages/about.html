	<h2>HMS 90th Anniversary</h2>

	<p>The year 2013 marks the ninetieth anniversary of the Haslemere Musical Society
	which was started modestly in 1923 by a local music teacher Annie Bristow.</p>

	<p>One of her pupils was Jill Pite, long-time secretary of HMS, who has recorded
	 her early memories of the Society which rehearsed in the Haslemere Hall before
	any of the modern comforts had been installed. In those early days the
	orchestra rehearsed first. Anthony Barnard, the conductor, then rehearsed the
	choir by which time he was so cold he had to be given two baked potatoes to
	warm his hands.</p>
	 
	<p>Since that time the Society, still comprising an amateur orchestra and choir,
	has gone from strength to strength and now offers the opportunity for audiences
	to hear live concerts of a high standard and for members to indulge in singing
	and playing under professional guidance. Rehearsals take place in the Haslemere
	Hall (<a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=490369&amp;Y=133095&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=115">map</a>), 
	on Monday evenings at 7.30 pm from September until May with open sessions
	in June.</p>

	<p>Members are amateur players and singers, while the Director of Music, Leader of
	the Orchestra, Choir Master and Soloists are professional appointments.</p>

	<p>New members, both singers and instrumentalists are always welcome bringing
	enthusiasm, commitment and a love of music (<a href="join.html">more details</a>).
