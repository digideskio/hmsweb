<h2>Haslemere Musical Society</h2>

</div>

<div class="content_col_lhs">

	<p>The year 2013 marks the ninetieth anniversary of the Haslemere Musical Society
	which was started modestly in 1923 by a local music teacher, Annie Bristow.</p>

	<p>One of her pupils was Jill Pite, long-time secretary of HMS, who has recorded
	 her early memories of the Society which rehearsed in the Haslemere Hall before
	any of the modern comforts had been installed. In those early days the
	orchestra rehearsed first. Anthony Barnard, the conductor, then rehearsed the
	choir by which time he was so cold he had to be given two baked potatoes to
	warm his hands.</p>
	 
	<p>Since that time the Society, still comprising an amateur orchestra and choir,
	has gone from strength to strength and now offers the opportunity for audiences
	to hear live concerts of a high standard and for members to indulge in singing
	and playing under professional guidance.</p>

	<p>To mark the occasion of this 90<sup>th</sup> year Roger Dellar, a local artist
	painted some scenes of the orchestra rehearsing in the Hall (see below). Roger
	Dellar is a self-taught professional figurative artist who works in pastels,
	mixed media, oils and acrylics. His key interest lies in observing people in
	their varied environments and recording them with a particular concentration on
	effects of light.</p>

	<img src="images/dellarPaintings.png" />

	<p>His paintings present an intimate and colourful interpretation of
	everyday life, with an individual focus capturing gesture and interaction that
	sets Roger's work apart. The situations and characters in his paintings inspire
	a voyeuristic feel that is testament to Roger's ability to paint a moment, even
	an instant, and successfully relay thought and sense to the viewer.</p>
