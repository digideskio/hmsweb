		<h2>Splendid Haslemere Musical Society concert rounds off autumn term</h2>

		<p>When Mozart struggled on his death bed to complete the Requiem he had been anonymously
		commissioned to write, he could hardly have dreamt of the acclaim that the work would receive
		internationally. Almost 220 years to the day after the composer's death the Haslemere Symphony
		Orchestra and Chorus performed the Requiem, in its traditional completion by S&uuml;ssmayr, at the
		Haslemere Hall. And what a performance it was. The orchestra, strengthened by some competent
		trombone playing, played confidently throughout - I was particularly struck by a fine viola solo
		near the beginning of the 'Recordatus' movement (the viola was Mozart's favourite string
		instrument), and the wind Harmonie made a splendid sound - the clarinets sounded distinctly like
		basset clarinets. The chorus, well drilled by Michael Veazey, sang capably, with excellent
		articulation and clarity. Soloists Sara Wallander-Ross (soprano), Marie Degodet (mezzo), Arthur
		Swan (tenor), and Leandros Taliotis (baritone) made good individual contributions and blended
		exceptionally well in the quartet passages - even if Mozart seemed to have written the bass part
		for a true bass. The performance was beautifully shaped by conductor James Ross, and made one
		think, again, of what Mozart might have contributed to the world of church music had he survived to
		take on the promised post at St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.</p>

		<p>The evening began with a vivid performance of Schumann's 'Rhenish' Symphony, written, according
		to James Ross, with a wide smile and a tankard of beer in one hand. An essentially jovial piece, it
		presented quite a challenge for the orchestra, but the splendid slow processional movement
		depicting a ceremony in Cologne Cathedral, and the jubilant brassy conclusion to the finale,
		sounded magnificent indeed.</p>
