		<h2>Glorious Christmas Oratorio</h2>

		<p>The Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus's December concert in the Haslemere Hall (Saturday
		4th December) was a great occasion, not least because the unexpected thaw meant that they had
		performers, and a sizeable audience.</p>

		<p>The programme began with Beethoven's Egmont Overture. Conductor James Ross ensured a sense of
		pent tension in the opening bars, and a glorious forward momentum in the crescendo passages. The
		orchestra was on the stage, an experiment which proved effective visually, but which enhanced the
		dryness of the acoustic and exposed any faux pas made by this dedicated group of amateur musicians:
		amateur in the best sense of the word in that they meet together to play simply because they love
		to do it. Having said that, they really gave their best in a performance of Brahms's astonishing
		Double Concerto for violin and cello. Written in a (successful) attempt to be reconciled with his
		friend Joseph Joachim, this work displays all the mellowness of the composer's later years. Yet
		there is much virtuoso playing required of the soloists, on this occasion Jonathan Strange and
		Lesley Shrigley Jones who blended wonderfully in the many octave passages. It was a sturdy,
		committed performance which received the ovation it deserved.</p>

		<p>The second half was devoted to a most imaginative presentation of Bach's ‘Christmas Oratorio'.
		Consisting of six separate cantatas, the entire work is far too long to include in any concert
		programme, but the Haslemere Musical Society solved the problem by drawing on the expertise of one
		of its members, broadcaster Martin Muncaster, who linked the choral passages with effective
		readings from the King James Bible. The chorus, well drilled by chorus master Michael Veazey, was
		on top form, disciplined, with excellent articulation, diction, and pronunciation of the German
		text, and the orchestra accompanied very effectively from the stage: here, with the choir in front,
		we could see the advantage of the new arrangement.</p>

		<p>An effective choral setting of the carol Shepherds, Shake off your Drousy Sleep by Martin
		Muncaster's brother Clive (who resides ‘over the pond') and a couple of rousing and well-known
		carols for the audience rounded off a splendid evening.</p>
