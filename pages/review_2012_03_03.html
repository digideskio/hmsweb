		<h2>Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus perform ambitious programme</h2>
		<h3>Haslemere Hall - 3rd March 2012</h3>

		<p>Under their conductor James Ross the Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus have continued the
		habit of putting on ambitious programmes and bringing them off successfully. Last Saturday's
		concert in the Haslemere Hall was no exception. Although the acoustic of Haslemere's only sizeable
		performing venue is notably dry, the orchestra, skilfully led by Tom Horn, managed to produce a
		rich and vibrant sound in Mendelssohn's stormy Hebrides overture with its stirring themes and broad
		concepts: the busy string parts and the tuneful wind likewise came over successfully in a well
		balanced performance with an admirable attention to light and shade.</p>

		<p>Elgar's The Music Makers is a setting of a text by Arthur O'Shaughnessy which is very much of
		its time and appealed enormously to the composer, who infused his setting with nostalgic references
		to many of his earlier works. It covers the whole range of dramatic emotion, and changes of speed
		which were not always comfortable, but the performance was an admirable effort on the part of both
		orchestra and chorus. Mezzo soprano Helen Anne Gregory's rendering of the solo part was indeed
		beautiful and stirring, and the well-drilled chorus was attentive and alert, as was the orchestra
		for the most part. There's nothing wrong with putting on an ambitious project when it works out as
		well as this one did.</p>

		<p>Sibelius's Third Symphony was another ambitious choice. This work, not frequently enough performed,
		came over splendidly. There was a nice build-up to the climax in the first movement, some
		delightful wind playing in the second, and a wonderful transition to the big tune and its insistent
		accompaniment in the third - and congratulations particularly to the cellos, and, indeed, to each
		one of the performers. Well done!</p>
