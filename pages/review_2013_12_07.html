		<h2>90 years young</h2>

		<p>The concert given by Haslemere Musical Society's symphony orchestra and chorus
		on Saturday marked the 90th anniversary of its first concert, and demonstrated their
		ability to excel in a contrasted programme of classical masterpieces.</p>

		<p>Under the experienced baton of Dr. James Ross, the orchestra shone in Beethoven's 3rd
		symphony, a powerful work lasting nearly 50 minutes, requiring great concentration
		from the orchestral players. From the massive initial two chords to the hectic finale,
		momentum was maintained with controlled enthusiasm, and the tricky rhythmic changes
		rendered exciting by the players' assurance. The horns gave a notable contribution
		in the scherzo.</p>

		<p>Three sections of Bach's cantata Wachet Auf (Sleepers awake) provided familiar
		melodies in both choral and orchestral parts, conducted by Chorus Master Christopher
		Hann with rhythmic verve. Bach makes formidable demands on his singers, his settings
		are both high and loud, and the large chorus was in confident form.</p>

		<p>Dr Ross then returned to conduct Vivaldi's Gloria, a justly popular work. The setting
		is divided into 12 short sections, calling on the chorus and soloists to express a variety
		of religious feeling. All rose to the occasion with aplomb. The two lady soloists joined
		in a lively pairing in Laudamus Te, and the gentle  6th movement Domine Deus, with soprano
		(Sara Wallander-Ross) and oboe (David Farnworth), was performed with moving sincerity.  The
		two solo movements for mezzo soprano are more sombre and Angharad Lewis sang these with
		suitable dignity. The rousing final chorus brought this excellent concert to a close.</p>

		<p>The Society continues to rely on a sturdy body of 100 enthusiastic musicians who meet
		to enjoy the pleasures of rehearsal and public performance, as we were reminded by short
		addresses by the Chairman and the Musical Director. We, the audience, fully appreciate
		their hard work and look forward to their future concerts leading to the Centenary celebrations
		in 2023!</p>
