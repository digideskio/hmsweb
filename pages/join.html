	<h2>Join Us</h2>

	<p>HMS is one of the few societies to have both an orchestra and a choir.
	We are always pleased to welcome new members - both singers and
	instrumentalists. All we ask of our members is that they should be enthusiastic
	and committed.</p>

	<p>New choir members are always welcome (sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses).
	No audition is required. Come along to any rehearsal and meet us all.</p>

	<p>The orchestra is currently expanding and recruiting new high standard
	musicians. There are currently vacancies for violins, brass and a timpanist
	(an instrument is available). Auditions may be required for wind and brass
	vacancies..  Other instrumentalists are welcome to inquire about extra playing
	and deputising opportunities.</p>

	<p>Both choir and orchestra rehearse on Monday evenings from 7.30 to 10.00
	in the <a href="http://www.haslemerehall.co.uk/">Haslemere Hall</a>,
	between September and May. There is normally a final rehearsal during the
	afternoon before each concert.</p>


	<p>The society also meets for a number of summer sessions, working
	with invited conductors.</p>

	<h2>Summer Sessions 2013</h2>
	<div>

		<p>At the summer sessions HMS welcomes musicians and singers who are not
		currently members of the Society.  We normally run four sessions, some for
		orchestra only and others involving the chorus.  Various works are sight-read 
		and performed with a guest conductor. A charge of &pound;4 is made to cover
		music hire, venue and refreshments.  The Society welcomes musicians and singers
		who are not currently members of the Society.</p>

		<p>The sessions are in the <a href="http://www.haslemerehall.co.uk/">Haslemere Hall</a>
		(please use the rear entrance) from 7.30 to 10.00pm.</p>

	<h2>Come and Sing 2013</h2>

	<p>In the Spring, a Come and Sing event was held in St Christopher's
	Church, Weyhill, where Faur&eacute;'s Requiem was studied under Christopher
	Hann as conductor with Clive Osgood accompanying. The orchestra joined the
	choir for the final run-through, performed to an audience of friends and
	family.  </p>

	<p>We anticipate 'come and sing' events in the future where both
	society members and others can join us in learning a new work.</p>
