	<h2>Welcome</h2>

	<p>HMS is one of the few societies to have both an orchestra and a choir.
	We are always pleased to welcome new members - both singers and
	instrumentalists. All we ask of our members is that they should be enthusiastic
	and committed.</p>

	<p>New choir members are always welcome (sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses).
	No audition required. Come along to any rehearsal and meet us all.</p>

	<p>The orchestra is currently expanding and recruiting new high standard
	musicians. There are currently vacancies for strings: violins, brass,
	timpanist (instrument available),  auditions may be required for wind/brass
	vacancies).  Other instrumentalists are welcome to inquire about extra-playing
	and deputising opportunities.</p>

	<p>Both choir and orchestra rehearse on Monday evenings from 7.30 to 10.00
	in the <a href="http://www.haslemerehall.co.uk/">Haslemere Hall</a>,
	between September and May. There is normally a final rehearsal during the
	afternoon before each concert</p>


	<p>The orchestra also meets for a number of summer sessions as well, working
	with invited conductors.</p>

		<p>In the Summer the Society runs four Summer Sessions which again are
		<b>open to all</b>. One session is with both the orchestra and chorus and the
		others are normally for orchestra only. This year there is an extra choir only
		session. Various works are sight read and performed with a guest conductor. A
		charge of &pound;4 is made to cover music hire, venue and refreshments.  The
		Society welcomes musicians and singers who are not currently members of the
		Society.</p>

		<p>The sessions are in the <a href="http://www.haslemerehall.co.uk/">Haslemere Hall</a>

	<h2>Come and Sing 2013</h2>

	<p>In the Spring, a Come and Sing event was held in St Christophers
	Church, Weyhill, where a Faur&eacute;'s Requiem was studied under Christopher
	Hann as conductor with Clive Osgood accompanying. The orchestra joined the
	choir for the final run-through, performed to an audience of friends and
	family.  </p>

	<p>We anticipate 'come and sing' events in the future where both
	society members and others can join us in learning a new work.</p>

	<p>Member subscription for the 2012-13 season is Â£95 (students half price)
	payable at the first rehearsal of the season (first Monday in September). </p>

	<o>Part of the subscriptions may be Gift Aided if you have made a Declaration.
