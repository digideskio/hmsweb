		<h2>Great Finale to Haslemere Musical Society's Season</h2>

		<p>The Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus began its final concert of the season with a
		youthful work by Puccini. His Messa di Gloria was a graduation piece, and it showed, with long
		academic fugues and, in the first three movements, over-extended word settings. However some lovely
		melodic twists and bold modulations forecast the mature opera composer of later years. It was
		perhaps a mistake to put it at the beginning of the programme: the exposed strings and the initial
		choral entry sounded far from confident, and it is a big work to sing. But there were some great
		moments as the chorus and orchestra under the skilful direction of James Ross rose to the
		quasi-operatic climaxes and supported the soloists admirably. The tenor Stephen Brown betrayed
		considerable operatic experience in his approach to his solos, and baritone James Balance gave a
		touching rendering of the Benedictus, even if the striking Crucifixus seemed a little low-placed
		for his voice.</p>

		<p>Chorus and orchestra were on better form in the second half for the striking prelude to Verdi's
		early opera Nabucco followed by the famous ‘Va Pensiero', the lament of the Hebrew slaves, which
		received an effective performance. Many of the melodies in Rossini's ballet music from his final
		opera William Tell were familiar to those who had tackled Britten's Matinées Musicales
		arrangements, and there was a Tyrolean and Schubertian element as well.</p>

		<p>Then we were transported from Italy to England for a rumbustious ‘Last Night of the Proms',
		complete with Union Jacks and the words ‘Land of Hope and Glory' sung with gusto as the orchestra
		gave their very best in Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance no. 1 and then the Hornpipe from Henry Wood's
		Sea Songs. And the grand finale was, of course, Parry's setting of Blake's Jerusalem.</p>

		<p>The Society has some ‘sight reading' evenings for members and guests throughout the summer, and
		the orchestra will perform again on Saturday 14th at the northern end of the Hindhead Tunnel to
		accompany those fortunate enough to have obtained tickets for the ‘walk through' on Saturday 14th
		May.</p>
