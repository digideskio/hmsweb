				<p>The Haslemere Musical Society was founded in 1923 and gave annual
					concerts up until 1939. Since then it has performed two or three
					concerts a year of classical works, and it now has a
					considerable following.</p>
				<p>The H.M.S. is one of comparatively few societies to have both an
					orchestra and a choir. The programmes have included choral works
					like <i>The Dream of Gerontius</i>, <i>Messiah</i> and
					<i>Creation</i>, and the symphonies of Brahms, Beethoven and
					Tchaikovsky; also a variety of shorter and more modern works. We
					recently gave the first performance of a new work (Lord of all
					Creation) by our last conductor Darrell Davison. </p>
				<p>Both choir and orchestra rehearse on a Monday evening at 7.30 in
					the Haslemere Hall, between September and May.</p>
				<p>The orchestra usually meets for a number of summer sessions as
					well, working with invited conductors.</p>

				music and a doctorate in French opera, winning the Sir Donald Tovey Prize. He
				was a finalist in the 1998 BBC Philharmonic Conducting Competition and since
				then he has conducted over 800 works in fourteen countries throughout Europe,
				North America and Asia. In addition to Haslemere Musical Society, current music
				director positions include Sidcup Symphony Orchestra, Oxford Opera Company,
				Welwyn Garden City Orchestra and Chorus, and previously St. Albans Symphony

				London, and the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford. 
			<h3>Repertoire</h3>
			<p> Repertoire performed includes much
				symphonic work (e.g. almost all of Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky,
				Dvorák, Brahms); oratorios (e.g. Elgar, The Dream of Gerontius); and major
				20th-Century works including Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring, Bartók, Music for
				Strings, Percussion and Celesta; and Schoenberg, Pierrot Lunaire. Soloists range
				from baritone Sir Thomas Allen to former BBC Young Musician of the Year Guy
				Johnston; operas include works by Bizet, Britten, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Verdi,
				Puccini, Wagner and Janacék. He has also conducted much specialist French
				repertoire and has a strong interest in contemporary music. Numerous first
				performances include New Music Days with members of City of London Sinfonia,
				supported by the =Arts Council of England.

	<h1>The Society performs three concerts with the Orchestra and Chorus every
		year in the Haslemere Hall.  An additional orchestral concert is held in St
		Christopher’s Church, Weyhill, often featuring a soloist from within the
		orchestra. <br />
		Tickets are available from Society members, the <a href="http://www.haslemerehall.co.uk/">Haslemere Hall</a> Box
		Office or <a href="http://www.intelligent-tickets.com/index.php?th=hh">online</a>.
	</h1>
	<p>New singers and orchestral players are always welcome to join the
	society. No auditions are required, since members can usually
	discover for themselves whether they are able to meet the standards
	set by the chorus master Jeanette Gallant and conductor James Ross.</p> -->
