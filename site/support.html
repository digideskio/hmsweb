<h2>Support Us</h2>

<div class="content_col">

	<p>HMS is proud of its achievements. We pay our own basic running and rehearsal costs, but are
	dependent on our supporters to enable us to realise our musical aspirations, particularly to help
	us with the increasing cost of staging concerts and hiring top-class soloists and other
	professionals. Even with a full house, our ticket and programme sales do not cover expenses.</p>

	<p>We also seek to encourage students to join us by halving our normal subscription fees, and by
	promoting participation in concerts by children at local schools.  New para Please help us to
	realise these goals by contributing financially.</p>

	<p>Our goals include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Encouraging students to join us (choir or orchestra), by
			waiving almost all of our normal subscription fees.</li>
		<li>Promoting participation in concerts by children at
			local schools. HMS members themselves pay the basic
			running and rehearsal costs, but depend on supporters to
			help maintain financial independence - and thus artistic
			freedom.  </li>

	<h3>Shop Online</h3>

	<p>Shop online and raise money for HMS at no cost to yourself!</p>

	<p>HMS is registered with easyfundraising.org as this is one of the easiest ways to help raise money
	for the Society. If you already shop online with retailers such as: Amazon, M&amp;S, Argos, John Lewis,
	Comet, Vodafone, eBay, WH Smith, Waitrose and Sainsburyâ€™s you can sign up for free and raise money
	while you shop.</p>

	<p>Each time you shop online, go to 
	<a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/haslemeremusicalsociety" target="_blank">easyfundraising.org.uk</a> 
	 and make your purchase in the normal way.  You will pay the same price as you 
	would by going directly to the retailer but a percentage (up to 15%) is paid by 
	the retailer to the HMS account. Your purchase is with the retailer so your normal
	rights are protected and so sign up now to start making a difference.</p>

	<p>How much can you raise? Spend &pound;100 with M&amp;S online or Amazon
		and you raise &pound;2.50 for us. &pound;100 with WH Smith puts &pound;2.00 in
		our pocket and so on. There are over 2,000 retailers on
		their site, and some of the donations can be as much as 15%
		of your purchase. Save money too! Easyfundraising is FREE to
		use plus you'll get access to hundreds of exclusive
		discounts and voucher codes, so not only will you be helping
		us, you'll be saving money yourself.  We need your help to
		start donations coming in. Join now and sign up to start
		making a difference ... simply by shopping. </p>

	<h3>Become a Friend</h3>

	<p>HMS Friends are the vital core of an appreciative and discerning audience, and are a
	sociable group of like-minded music lovers.</p>

	<p>Friends are kept in touch with our plans and activities through regular newsletters from the
	Secretary, who is a member of the choir.</p>

	<p>A Friends subscription is just &pound;20 per annum, and you will receive our newsletter and
	other relevant communications. We will also include your name in our concert programmes and on our
	website </p>


	<p>Joint membership is available at &pound;35 per annum and provides all the benefits of
	individual membership for two people sharing a joint subscription and mailings to a single
	address.</p>

</div>
<div class="content_col_lhs">
	<a id="patron"></a>
	<h3>Become a Patron</h3>

	<p>We are especially grateful for annual donations from our Patrons.</p>

	<p>A Patrons subscription is &pound;50 per annum, and in addition to the benefits accruing to our
	Friends, we further show our appreciation by offering you a complimentary programme and a free
	interval drink, inviting you to our post-concert parties and other social events, and giving you
	the opportunity to attend rehearsals. You will also have a Patrons card.</p>

	<p>Joint membership is available from &pound;90 per annum for Patrons and
		provides all the benefits of individual membership for two
		people sharing a joint subscription and mailings to a single
		address.</p>

	<h2>Sponsor</h2>

	<p>We welcome one-off or continuing donations, and are very grateful to the following
	organisations for their generous support:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Betty Parr Whitbread Trust</li>
		<li>Community Foundation for Surrey</li>
		<li>Tunnel Vision Fund</li>
		<li>Waitrose</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Gift Aid</h2>

	<p>If you are a UK taxpayer, using Gift Aid means that for every
		pound you give, we get an extra 25p from the Inland Revenue,
		helping your donation go further.</p>
	<p>If you are a higher rate taxpayer, you can claim back the
		difference between the basic and higher rate tax paid,
		reducing the net cost to you of your gift.</p>
	<p>Example: A higher-rate taxpayer who becomes a Patron of HMS
		with a donation of &pound;100 would incur a net cost of just &pound;75
		per annum, see below: </p>
	<table>

	<h2>Legacies</h2>

	<h3>Why (not) leave a legacy to HMS?</h3>

	<p>If you have valued your association with HMS, whether as a singing member, orchestral member
	or as part of the audience, you will know how much the Society has given to you, perhaps over many
	years, through the magnificence, beauty and emotional power of music.</p>

	<p>We need your help to safeguard the future of HMS and to ensure that the next generation of
	singers, players and audience may experience HMS as you have known and loved it.</p>

	<p>If you would like to leave a legacy to HMS in your will, your best course of action is to
	arrange this through your own solicitor. If you prefer, the Chairman will be pleased to put you in
	touch with an experienced solicitor, connected to HMS, who can offer you professional
	assistance.</p>

	<p>HMS is very grateful for all legacies and is happy to recognise your generosity, if you
	wish, with an acknowledgement in our concert programme. If you are able to leave &pound;5000 or
	more, we will be pleased to dedicate a concert in your memory.</p>
