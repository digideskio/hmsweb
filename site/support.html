<h2>Support us</h2>

<div class="content_col">
	<p>HMS is proud of its achievements but we receive no funding
		from the Arts Council. We are therefore dependent on our
		supporters to enable us to realise our musical aspirations
		but the cost of promoting and staging our concerts is
		increasingly expensive.  Please help us to attain our
		objectives by contributing financially.</p>

	<p>We are committed to promoting our own concerts and engaging
		professional performers where necessary but frequently have
		costs of around &pound;2,000 per performance, including hire of
		the Hall, orchestra and top class soloists. Even with a full
		house, ticket and programme sales do not cover expenses.
		</p>
	<p>Our goals include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Encouraging students to join us (choir or orchestra), by
			waiving almost all of our normal subscription fees.</li>
		<li>Promoting participation in concerts by children at
			local schools. HMS members themselves pay the basic
			running and rehearsal costs, but depend on supporters to
			help maintain financial independence - and thus artistic
			freedom.  </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Raise money for the society while shopping online</h3>

	<p>Shop Online and Raise Money for HMS at no cost to yourself!
	<p>We have registered HMS with easyfundraising.org.
		It's the easiest way to help raise money for the Society! If
		you already shop online with retailers such as Amazon, M&S,
		Argos, John Lewis, Comet, Vodafone, eBay, WH Smith,
		Waitrose, Sainsbury etc we need you to sign up for free to
		raise money while you shop! So how does it work? </p>
	<ol>
		
		<li>To start go onto the <a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/haslemeremusicalsociety" target="_blank">Easyfundraising</a> 
			web site then click on 'sign up' and register. Using
			this link will automatically establish HMS as the
			charity you are supporting.</li>
			
		<li>Each time you shop, go to the <a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/haslemeremusicalsociety" target="_blank">Easyfundraising</a>
			website first, click on the link to the shop/business
			you want and make your purchase in the normal way. The
			retailers are easy to find as they are listed both by
			type and alphabetically. You pay exactly the same price
			as you would by going directly to the retailer but a
			percentage (up to 15%) is paid by the retailer to the
			HMS account with Easyfundraising. Your purchase is with
			the retailer so your normal rights are protected.</li>
		</ol>

	<p>How much can you raise? Spend &pound;100 with M&amp;S online or Amazon
		and you raise &pound;2.50 for us. &pound;100 with WH Smith puts &pound;2.00 in
		our pocket and so on. There are over 2,000 retailers on
		their site, and some of the donations can be as much as 15%
		of your purchase. Save money too! Easyfundraising is FREE to
		use plus you'll get access to hundreds of exclusive
		discounts and voucher codes, so not only will you be helping
		us, you'll be saving money yourself.  We need your help to
		start donations coming in. Join now and sign up to start
		making a difference ... simply by shopping. </p>

	<h2>Donations and Gift Aid</h2>

	<p>HMS welcomes one-off donations and gifts.</p>
	<h2>Gift Aid</h2>
	<p>If you are a UK taxpayer, using Gift Aid means that for every
		pound you give, we get an extra 25p from the Inland Revenue,
		helping your donation go further.</p>
	<p>If you are a higher rate taxpayer, you can claim back the
		difference between the basic and higher rate tax paid,
		reducing the net cost to you of your gift.</p>
	<p>Example: A higher-rate taxpayer who becomes a Patron of HMS
		with a donation of &pound;100 would incur a net cost of just &pound;75
		pa. see below: </p>
	<table>

	<h2>Remember HMS in your Will</h2>

	<h3>Why (not) leave a legacy to HMS?</h3>

	<p>If you have valued your association with HMS, whether as a
		singing member, orchestral member or as part of the
		audience, you will know how much the Society has given to
		you, perhaps over many years, through the magnificence,
		beauty and emotional power of music.</p>

	<p>We need your help to safeguard the future of HMS and to
		ensure that the next generation of singers, players and
		audience may experience HMS as you have known and loved
		it.</p>

	<h3>Preparing your legacy</h3> 

	<p>If you would like to leave a legacy to HMS in your Will, your
		best course of action is to arrange this through your own
		solicitor. If you prefer, the Chairman will be pleased to
		put you in touch with an experienced solicitor, connected to
		HMS, who can offer you professional assistance.</p>

	<p>HMS is very grateful for all legacies and is happy to
		recognise your generosity, if you wish, in the following
		ways: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>For gifts of &pound;5,000 or more, HMS will be pleased to dedicate a concert in your memory</li>
		<li>Your donation would be acknowledged in the HMS concert programme</li>
