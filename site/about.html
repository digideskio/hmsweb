	<h2>About Us</h2>

	<p>The year 2013 marks the ninetieth anniversary of the Haslemere Musical Society
	which was started modestly in 1923 by a local music teacher, Annie Bristow.</p>

	<p>One of her pupils was Jill Pite, long-time secretary of HMS, who has recorded
	 her early memories of the Society which rehearsed in the Haslemere Hall before
	any of the modern comforts had been installed. In those early days the
	orchestra rehearsed first. Anthony Barnard, the conductor, then rehearsed the
	choir by which time he was so cold he had to be given two baked potatoes to
	warm his hands.</p>
	 
	<p>Since that time the Society, still comprising an amateur orchestra and choir,
	has gone from strength to strength and now offers the opportunity for audiences
	to hear live concerts of a high standard and for members to indulge in singing
	and playing under professional guidance. Rehearsals take place in the Haslemere
	Hall (<a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=490369&amp;Y=133095&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=115">map</a>), 
	on Monday evenings at 7.30 pm from September until May with open sessions
	in June.</p>

	<p>Members are amateur players and singers, while the Director of Music, Leader of
	the Orchestra, Chorus Master and Soloists are professional appointments.</p>

	<p>New members, both singers and instrumentalists, are always welcome bringing
	enthusiasm, commitment and a love of music (<a href="join.html">more details</a>).

		<h2>Orchestra Leader: Tom Horn</h2>

		<p>Tom began learning the violin from a very early age and through his youth has played
		with youth orchestras in Kent, the Channel Islands and London.  Most notably Tom was leader of the
		London Schools Symphony Orchestra, which enabled him to work with world-renowned artists such as
		Thomas Sanderling, Alexandre Markov and Robbie Coltrane.</p>

		<p>In 2003 Tom went to study music with acoustics at Southampton University; he quickly
		surrounded himself with everything musical and became the leader/conductor of both the Symphony
		Orchestra and the Sinfonietta Orchestra. Tom also set up his own orchestra, the 'concerto ensemble'
		performing works both old and new.  Tom has played with various orchestras and in numerous venues
		all over the world. In 2004 he formed the 'Stellar Quartet', with whom he has played at many
		functions and concerts, and performed for HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, Betty Boothroyd and John
		Williams. The eclectic mix of chamber music that Tom has performed and recorded ranges from Mozart
		and Dutilleux to compositions written for the quartet by contemporary composers. His latest project
		is performing an arrangement of 'Kid A' by Radiohead with electronics, which is going to be taken
		to the Edinburgh Festival.</p>

		<p>After gaining one of the highest performance marks at the university Tom is now a
		freelance violinist and teacher in North London; he is continuing his studies with various tutors
		of differing musical styles throughout the country.  He hopes to continue performing and
		conducting with projects he has set up, such as the 'Charity Symphony Orchestra'. The largest
		project in the pipeline is the 'Haydnathon' where all 104 symphonies will be played back to
		back.</p>
