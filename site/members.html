	<h2>Highlights of 2012-2013</h2>

	<p>In October 2012 we had a wonderful Orchestral concert in St Christopher's
	church with Mozart's overture to Don Giovanni, the Delius Song before
	Sunrise and Schubert's Symphony No 6. The highlight of the evening was
	Helen Owlett's beautiful clarinet playing in Weber's Clarinet Concerto
	and Finzi's Five Bagatelles. </p>

	<p>We are indeed fortunate to have such talent in our Orchestra. The December
	concert was a sell out for The Messiah (excerpts) and Beethoven's Symphony
	No 6, the Pastoral. Both were enthusiastically received by the large audience.
	In February we had a hugely successful Come and Sing in St Christopher's
	Church when Christopher Hann, our new Chorus Master, rehearsed a choir of over
	100 in Faur&eacute;'s Requiem with Clive Osgood on the organ. </p>

	<p>We were then joined by a small orchestra (mostly HMS members) for the
	performance which added much to the pleasure of the event for all present.
	Christopher has been a great success in everything he has done with us
	throughout his first season with us. </p>

	<img src="images/stChristophers.png"/>

	<p>The performance of Mendelssohn's Elijah in March was outstanding. Orchestra
	and Chorus were at their best on the night and the soloists were superb. Thanks
	to the sterling efforts of members of the Society in publicising the concert
	and selling tickets we had a near full house with only a few unsold seats
	downstairs.</p>

<div class="content_col_lhs">

	<p>The 2012 - 2013 HMS season ended on 4th May with a widely acclaimed concert of
	Opera Highlights.  This was a lighter than usual programme of music by Rossini,
	Donizetti, Gounod, Verdi, Mascagni, Puccini and Wagner which was performed by
	the orchestra and chorus with great enthusiasm.  An innovation was the
	inclusion of arias sung by three St Edmund's School (Hindhead) choristers.</p>

	<p>They delighted the audience with their remarkable vocal skill and their poise
	on stage.  The soprano soloist in Mascagni's Easter Hymn from Cavalleria
	Rusticana was local singer Joanna Bywater who gave a radiant performance.
	Altogether the concert was recognised as a tremendous tribute to local talent.</p>

	<p>During June the Society traditionally has four sessions which are open to
	anyone who wishes to play an instrument or sing for pleasure.  These Summer
	Sessions have different conductors who rehearse and then run through different
	works.  In the first half of the first session the orchestra leader, Tom Horn,
	guided the orchestra through Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice, a challenging piece
	which in the final run through conjured up images of Disney's Mickey Mouse in
	the film Fantasia. </p>

	<p>The orchestra and choir came together after the break and under the baton of
	Chorus Master Christopher Hann produced a rousing performance of Handel's
	Zadok the Priest and The King Shall Rejoice.</p>

<div class="img_col">

<div class="content_col">
	<p>The second session also involved both orchestra and choir.  Tom Horn
	conducted the orchestra for two pieces, one by Rawsthorne and one by Debussy
	while Sarah Thomas, a music student, rehearsed Parry's I was Glad with the
	choir.  The final run-through involved orchestra and choir energetically
	performing the Parry under the baton of Sarah.</p>

	<p>There was an innovation in the third session when the orchestra split into
	separate string and wind sections.  Christopher Hann took the strings for
	Dvor&#780;&aacute;k's delightful Serenade while the wind section enjoyed rehearsing another
	Dvor&#780;&aacute;k work, his Czech Suite under the baton of guest conductor, Bob
	Haselip.</p>

	<p>For the final session guest conductor Mark Cardy accepted the challenge to
	conduct two movements from Holst's Planets Suite:  Mars and Jupiter. This time
	the session was held in Grayswood Village Hall, not the Haslemere Hall and the
	orchestra managed to produce a resounding sound in the final run-through.</p>

	<p>The four sessions proved the value of giving the opportunity to musicians to
	experience a wide range of music and conducting styles and to tackle new works
	with great enjoyment.</p>

	<h2>HMS Anniversary Party</h2>

	<p>What a great way to end the HMS 90th Anniversary year in 2013!</p>

	<p>Members enjoyed a glass of mulled wine and tucked in to Lorraine Collins'
	wonderful Celebration Cake which not only looked great but was also delicious!</p>

	<p>December 2013 was a memorable month for HMS members. The concert on the 7th was
	a great success and much admired by both the audience and the reviewer. A special
	triumph was the re-incarnation of the Beethoven Eroica Symphony, played with piano
	support at the first HMS concert in 1923 but this time played with aplomb by the
	full orchestra.  The choir also excelled itself in the Vivaldi Gloria and the Bach Wachet Auf
	winning accolades all round.</p>
