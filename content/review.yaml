    heading: "Haslemere Symphony Orchestra excels in ambitious summer programme"
    text:
        "Notwithstanding the winter temperatures outside, a warm glow suffused the Haslemere Hall last
        Saturday when the Musical Society presented their summer programme. It was apparent from the outset
        that this chorus and orchestra have come on by leaps and bounds. That outset was the striking
        opening of Holst's Festival Te Deum, full of Dorian inflexions and whirling string sounds which
        sounded magnificent.

        It was followed by a remarkably bold and original Kyrie from the twenty-five-year-old Mozart,
        the kind of piece which made one regret that he never completed the Mass setting. It received a
        bold and confident performance from the chorus and the prominent wind parts in the orchestra were
        excellent.

        The orchestra, under its conductor James Ross, was on its own for the next item, four movements
        from Grieg's Peer Gynt. These were shot through with drama, from the scurrying opening of the
        abduction scene, through the evocative Morning and the lonely death scene, to a truly impressive
        and sinister depiction of the Hall of the Mountain King.

        The most unusual item of this very enterprising concert was the Fantasia for Soprano Saxophone
        and orchestra by Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos. Full of snappy rhythms and soulful melodies, this
        found saxophone soloist David Wigram at his scintillating best, as he responded to the many moods
        with an exquisite tone and sensitive rapport with the orchestra. This young man will go far.

        Henry Wood's guest Rachmaninov was profoundly moved by the premi&egrave;re of Vaughan Williams's
        Serenade to Music and the Haslemere performance of this glorious setting of Shakespeare's words was
        indeed moving. The warm, full choral sound and the beautifully phrased orchestral accompaniment
        were enhanced by the contribution of five soloists singing from within the choir to great effect.
        Soprano Susanna Hogan was particularly impressive.

        The sinister mood so effectively evoked in the Grieg re-appeared in Mussorgsky's wonderfully
        descriptive Night on a Bare Mountain. Wind, brass, percussion and strings all contributed
        magnificently to this colourful depiction of a Witches' Sabbath and James Ross drove his forces on
        with demonic ardour.

        Finally chorus and orchestra gave a vivacious and beautifully articulated account of Haydn's
        great Te Deum.

        "The Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus's December concert in the Haslemere Hall (Saturday
        4th December) was a great occasion, not least because the unexpected thaw meant that they had
        performers, and a sizeable audience.

        The programme began with Beethoven's Egmont Overture. Conductor James Ross ensured a sense of
        pent tension in the opening bars, and a glorious forward momentum in the crescendo passages. The
        orchestra was on the stage, an experiment which proved effective visually, but which enhanced the
        dryness of the acoustic and exposed any faux pas made by this dedicated group of amateur musicians:
        amateur in the best sense of the word in that they meet together to play simply because they love
        to do it. Having said that, they really gave their best in a performance of Brahms's astonishing
        Double Concerto for violin and cello. Written in a (successful) attempt to be reconciled with his
        friend Joseph Joachim, this work displays all the mellowness of the composer's later years. Yet
        there is much virtuoso playing required of the soloists, on this occasion Jonathan Strange and
        Lesley Shrigley Jones who blended wonderfully in the many octave passages. It was a sturdy,
        committed performance which received the ovation it deserved.

        The second half was devoted to a most imaginative presentation of Bach's 'Christmas Oratorio'.
        Consisting of six separate cantatas, the entire work is far too long to include in any concert
        programme, but the Haslemere Musical Society solved the problem by drawing on the expertise of one
        of its members, broadcaster Martin Muncaster, who linked the choral passages with effective
        readings from the King James Bible. The chorus, well drilled by chorus master Michael Veazey, was
        on top form, disciplined, with excellent articulation, diction, and pronunciation of the German
        text, and the orchestra accompanied very effectively from the stage: here, with the choir in front,
        we could see the advantage of the new arrangement.

        An effective choral setting of the carol Shepherds, Shake off your Drousy Sleep by Martin
        Muncaster's brother Clive (who resides 'over the pond') and a couple of rousing and well-known
        carols for the audience rounded off a splendid evening.

    text:
        "The Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus are known for presenting enterprising programmes,
        but few could have been more adventurous than their spring concert held on Saturday 5th March, to a
        capacity audience in the Haslemere Hall.

        It began with a rousing performance of Shostakovitch's Festival Overture which was marked by
        sharp rhythms and a wonderfully big tune from the strings.

        As conductor James Ross explained, Schubert may never have intended to 'finish' his Unfinished
        Symphony, notwithstanding the attempts of others to do so. Schubert's existing score received a
        well-rounded performance, with some lovely solo contributions from the wind instruments and
        thrilling build-ups to the great climaxes, even if the string tone could have been a bit more
        generous in the soaring melodies of this great composer of songs.
        
        It was then the turn of local organist and Society accompanist Clive Osgood to display his
        talent as a composer. His Festival Cantata, a setting of the Anglican canticles Te Deum and
        Jubilate Deo, is unashamedly popular in idiom, built over an insistent repeated motif, with strong
        choral lines which could have been projected more joyfully. This was, after all, a world premiére.
        The orchestral parts were complex, and very well managed, even if there could have been more of a
        crescendo in the central instrumental movement.
        
        And so to Brahms's evocative German Requiem, the composer's masterly setting of vernacular
        Biblical texts reflecting the human predicament. This demanding work received a very creditable,
        indeed moving, performance. The choir had been well schooled in their German pronunciation, and the
        performance was beautifully shaped by conductor James Ross, with plenty of light and shade. Good
        bold choral lines were the order of the day (despite one tentative entry from the altos), and
        Rebecca Moon and Jon Stainsby proved excellent soloists.

        "The Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus began its final concert of the season with a
        youthful work by Puccini. His Messa di Gloria was a graduation piece, and it showed, with long
        academic fugues and, in the first three movements, over-extended word settings. However some lovely
        melodic twists and bold modulations forecast the mature opera composer of later years. It was
        perhaps a mistake to put it at the beginning of the programme: the exposed strings and the initial
        choral entry sounded far from confident, and it is a big work to sing. But there were some great
        moments as the chorus and orchestra under the skilful direction of James Ross rose to the
        quasi-operatic climaxes and supported the soloists admirably. The tenor Stephen Brown betrayed
        considerable operatic experience in his approach to his solos, and baritone James Balance gave a
        touching rendering of the Benedictus, even if the striking Crucifixus seemed a little low-placed
        for his voice.

        Chorus and orchestra were on better form in the second half for the striking prelude to Verdi's
        early opera Nabucco followed by the famous 'Va Pensiero', the lament of the Hebrew slaves, which
        received an effective performance. Many of the melodies in Rossini's ballet music from his final
        opera William Tell were familiar to those who had tackled Britten's Matin&eacute;es Musicales
        arrangements, and there was a Tyrolean and Schubertian element as well.

        Then we were transported from Italy to England for a rumbustious 'Last Night of the Proms',
        complete with Union Jacks and the words 'Land of Hope and Glory' sung with gusto as the orchestra
        gave their very best in Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance no. 1 and then the Hornpipe from Henry Wood's
        Sea Songs. And the grand finale was, of course, Parry's setting of Blake's Jerusalem.

        The Society has some 'sight reading' evenings for members and guests throughout the summer, and
        the orchestra will perform again on Saturday 14th at the northern end of the Hindhead Tunnel to
        accompany those fortunate enough to have obtained tickets for the 'walk through' on Saturday 14th
        May.

        "When Mozart struggled on his death bed to complete the Requiem he had been anonymously
        commissioned to write, he could hardly have dreamt of the acclaim that the work would receive
        internationally. Almost 220 years to the day after the composer's death the Haslemere Symphony
        Orchestra and Chorus performed the Requiem, in its traditional completion by Süssmayr, at the
        Haslemere Hall. And what a performance it was. The orchestra, strengthened by some competent
        trombone playing, played confidently throughout - I was particularly struck by a fine viola solo
        near the beginning of the 'Recordatus' movement (the viola was Mozart's favourite string
        instrument), and the wind Harmonie made a splendid sound - the clarinets sounded distinctly like
        basset clarinets. The chorus, well drilled by Michael Veazey, sang capably, with excellent
        articulation and clarity. Soloists Sara Wallander-Ross (soprano), Marie Degodet (mezzo), Arthur
        Swan (tenor), and Leandros Taliotis (baritone) made good individual contributions and blended
        exceptionally well in the quartet passages - even if Mozart seemed to have written the bass part
        for a true bass. The performance was beautifully shaped by conductor James Ross, and made one
        think, again, of what Mozart might have contributed to the world of church music had he survived to
        take on the promised post at St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.

        The evening began with a vivid performance of Schumann's 'Rhenish' Symphony, written, according
        to James Ross, with a wide smile and a tankard of beer in one hand. An essentially jovial piece, it
        presented quite a challenge for the orchestra, but the splendid slow processional movement
        depicting a ceremony in Cologne Cathedral, and the jubilant brassy conclusion to the finale,
        sounded magnificent indeed.

        "Under their conductor James Ross the Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and Chorus have continued the
        habit of putting on ambitious programmes and bringing them off successfully. Last Saturday's
        concert in the Haslemere Hall was no exception. Although the acoustic of Haslemere's only sizeable
        performing venue is notably dry, the orchestra, skilfully led by Tom Horn, managed to produce a
        rich and vibrant sound in Mendelssohn's stormy Hebrides overture with its stirring themes and broad
        concepts: the busy string parts and the tuneful wind likewise came over successfully in a well
        balanced performance with an admirable attention to light and shade.

        Elgar's The Music Makers is a setting of a text by Arthur O'Shaughnessy which is very much of
        its time and appealed enormously to the composer, who infused his setting with nostalgic references
        to many of his earlier works. It covers the whole range of dramatic emotion, and changes of speed
        which were not always comfortable, but the performance was an admirable effort on the part of both
        orchestra and chorus. Mezzo soprano Helen Anne Gregory's rendering of the solo part was indeed
        beautiful and stirring, and the well-drilled chorus was attentive and alert, as was the orchestra
        for the most part. There's nothing wrong with putting on an ambitious project when it works out as
        well as this one did.

        Sibelius's Third Symphony was another ambitious choice. This work, not frequently enough performed,
        came over splendidly. There was a nice build-up to the climax in the first movement, some
        delightful wind playing in the second, and a wonderful transition to the big tune and its insistent
        accompaniment in the third - and congratulations particularly to the cellos, and, indeed, to each
        one of the performers. Well done!

    text:
        "Mendelssohn's Elijah was first performed in Birmingham in 1846. It was an instant success
        and has been in the choral repertory in this Country ever since. Haslemere Symphony Orchestra and
        chorus gave a spirited performance at Haslemere Hall on Saturday 2nd March and gave much enjoyment
        to a large audience.

        The superb choruses, whilst not approaching the majesty of the St Matthew Passion or Haydn's
        Creation nonetheless lift the heart and are, for most, not to be dismissed as mere sentimentality.
        With occasional lapses of ensemble, the orchestra was very well conducted by James Ross who brought
        the best out of the choir and the orchestra. \"Woe to him, let the guilty Prophet perish\", a
        somewhat operatic number, was particularly effective as was the more well-known \"Be not afraid\".
        The soloists were all of high quality particularly John Stainsby whose command of the part of
        Elijah was outstanding. His impeccable intonation and clear diction made this a memorable
        performance and he was well supported by the other soloists, Arthur Swan, a fine tenor, Sara
        Wallender Ross, who sang her solos with great sensitivity, and Cathy Bell,the mezzo contralto whose
        performance of the justly famous \"O rest in the Lord\" was touching and admirable.

        The best music is to be found in Part 2 where Elijah's frustration at his backsliding compatriots,
        urged on by Jezabel, create a musical and dramatic tension which is more effective than the contest
        with the priests of Baal in Part 1. The final choruses inspired the Orchestra, Choir and soloists
        to bring this excellent performance to a rousing finale.

        Elijah has its longeurs; it is patchy but it also has undoubted strengths drawing on classical
        tradition - Lutheran chorales, the great works of Bach, who was so admired by Mendelssohn, and
        Haydn's Creation --. Mendelssohn, although baptised as a Lutheran at the age of seven, wanted it to
        be true to its Old Testament biblical roots and viewed in this way, it succeeds without the need
        for sentimentality of which it is sometimes accused. At the end of his life, Mendelssohn, a superb
        craftsman, produced a work which fully justifies its enduring reputation. We salute the HSO and
        Chorus and all the soloists for a thoroughly enjoyable performance.

        "Haslemere Hall was the site of a celebration of local talent and enthusiasm on
        Saturday night (May 4) as the orchestra and chorus of the Haslemere Musical
        Society  gathered for a concert in their 90th anniversary season. Wearing
        colourful blouses and bow ties, the chorus set an appropriately festive tone
        for the spring-themed concert, which featured The Villagers' Chorus from
        Rossini's 'William Tell', Anvil Chorus from Verdi's 'Il
        Trovatore' and Procession and Chorale from Wagner's 'The
        Mastersingers of Nuremberg', among many other delights.

        The last of the sun's rays was still filtering into the hall as the
        orchestra commanded our attention with Rossini's 'The Barber of
        Seville' Overture. Under James Ross' energetic and very physical
        direction, the orchestra began strongly and continued to gain confidence and
        energy throughout the evening.  The chorus, too, rose to the not insignificant
        challenge of meeting the orchestra's energy and sound. While at times the
        chorus of happy villagers and wedding guests seemed somewhat underwhelmed, the
        whole of the evening was sung capably and was a tribute to the passions and
        talents of all the musicians involved.

        A particular treat were the arias sung by St Edmund's School (Hindhead)
        choristers Tallulah Horton, Sam Dashwood and Louis Denison-Foster.  Each showed
        remarkable vocal skill, and their poise and professionalism on stage were made
        more astounding by the revelation that none had ever sung with a full orchestra
        until the performance itself. It will be a pleasure to see these young singers
        continue to develop their talents in the coming years.

        Soprano soloist Joanna Bywater's radiant delivery of Mascagni's Easter
        Hymn proved to be one of the evening's highlights. Her performance was so
        captivating that even director James Ross lost his cool. Having reassured the
        audience during the 'William Tell' selection that no arrows would be
        shot during the performance, Ross surprised everyone (including himself) by
        sending his baton soaring into the stalls during the climactic moment.

        On such a lovely spring evening, it was good to hear the Haslemere Musical
        Society bringing off a lighter repertoire as effectively as the weightier
        oratorios we have heard recently. I look forward to future concerts with great
        anticipation.

        "The Haslemere Musical Society, forever ambitious and resourceful, opened their
        season on  Saturday 19th October when the Haslemere Symphony Orchestra
        performed to a packed St Christopher's Church.

        These purely amateur musicians perform because they love doing so, and there
        are no auditions as members can soon discern whether they are up to standard.
        And up to standard they certainly were in ambitious works by the French
        composers Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel. Known mainly for the famous
        Sicilienne, performed by flautists the world over, Fauré's suite taken from his
        incidental music for Maeterlinck's play Pélleas et Mélisande contains much
        haunting music reflecting the tragic nature of the drama. In this the oboe is
        prominent, and David Farnworth contributed brilliantly, partnered by some
        excellent flute, clarinet, and horn playing. The warm acoustics of the church
        gave the strings a wonderfully warm sound, which was also brought to bear in
        the following work. This was Maurice Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin,  a tribute
        not only to eighteenth-century musicians and musical life, but to the
        composer's friends killed in the First World War. Antique dances are given a
        piquant twist here, with much imaginative orchestration, and the strings
        excelled themselves in the final Rigaudon. But in other places, such as the
        dissonant Forlane we could have wished for a little more flow and a little less
        stiltedness from the interpretation of conductor James Ross.

        Johannes Brahms's D major Serenade is the work of a young man (not the stolid
        bearded figure of later years) still mourning his mentor Robert Schumann and
        not yet daring to emulate his hero Beethoven by writing a symphony (that was to
        come some fifteen years later). But the serenade, albeit modelled on Mozart's
        Posthorn Serenade, is symphonic in many ways, and in places sinks to tremendous
        emotional depths. Roger Doulton opened splendidly on the French horn, and
        indeed contributed wonderfully to the whole performance. There were glorious
        choirs of wind instruments and some lovely string playing.

        "The concert given by Haslemere Musical Society's symphony orchestra and chorus
        on Saturday marked the 90th anniversary of its first concert, and demonstrated their
        ability to excel in a contrasted programme of classical masterpieces.

        Under the experienced baton of Dr. James Ross, the orchestra shone in Beethoven's 3rd
        symphony, a powerful work lasting nearly 50 minutes, requiring great concentration
        from the orchestral players. From the massive initial two chords to the hectic finale,
        momentum was maintained with controlled enthusiasm, and the tricky rhythmic changes
        rendered exciting by the players' assurance. The horns gave a notable contribution
        in the scherzo.

        Three sections of Bach's cantata Wachet Auf (Sleepers awake) provided familiar
        melodies in both choral and orchestral parts, conducted by Chorus Master Christopher
        Hann with rhythmic verve. Bach makes formidable demands on his singers, his settings
        are both high and loud, and the large chorus was in confident form.

        Dr Ross then returned to conduct Vivaldi's Gloria, a justly popular work. The setting
        is divided into 12 short sections, calling on the chorus and soloists to express a variety
        of religious feeling. All rose to the occasion with aplomb. The two lady soloists joined
        in a lively pairing in Laudamus Te, and the gentle  6th movement Domine Deus, with soprano
        (Sara Wallander-Ross) and oboe (David Farnworth), was performed with moving sincerity.  The
        two solo movements for mezzo soprano are more sombre and Angharad Lewis sang these with
        suitable dignity. The rousing final chorus brought this excellent concert to a close.

        The Society continues to rely on a sturdy body of 100 enthusiastic musicians who meet
        to enjoy the pleasures of rehearsal and public performance, as we were reminded by short
        addresses by the Chairman and the Musical Director. We, the audience, fully appreciate
        their hard work and look forward to their future concerts leading to the Centenary celebrations
        in 2023!

        "FROM small beginnings in 1923, Haslemere Musical Society (HMS) is now both
        a force to be reckoned with and something of a rarity.

        The society is unusual in that it is one of the very few across the UK to have both
        an orchestra and a choir. It is also very fortunate to have Dr James Ross, an
        inspirational and high-profile British conductor as its musical director.

        Fresh from the success of a sell-out ‘Come and Sing’ concert at St Christopher’s Church
        in Haslemere, orchestra and choir are now gearing up for their next big challenge, They
        will play Dvořák’s Symphony No. 6 and sing Bruckner’s very moving Mass No. 1 in D Minor
        during a joint concert in Haslemere Hall, on March 8.

        HMS choir members were joined by more than 100 singers from many different choirs and
        supported by around 40 members of the society’s symphony orchestra augmented by other
        local players for rehearsals on Saturday, under the baton of HMS professional chorus 
        master Christopher Hann. The highlight of the evening concert was the massed rendition of
        Handel’s coronation anthem Zadok the Priest and an impromptu performance of Parry’s Jerusalem.

        Ross, the society’s internationally acclaimed conductor, has been at the helm
        for more than six years and he is impressed by what HMS has to offer.
        “There are a only a very small number of comparable amateur organisations in the
        UK,” he told The Herald.
        “Mainly they have either a chorus or an orchestra but not both. It’s very rare and it
        brings huge advantages. “They can both rehearse in different parts of Haslemere
        Hall and come together as one unit.
        “Most choral societies have an orchestra that turns up on the day and they have
        one rehearsal beforehand.
        HMS has the luxury of working together to build a performance.
        “Without amateur musicians, such as those in HMS, and the dedicated music
        lovers that come to hear them, there would be no professional music industry.
        “I am an adviser to major record companies and major players in the music industry,
        and it is really evident what an important dynamic the amateur sector is.
        “The UK is the world’s largest market after the US and Japan by a big margin.
        “I’m convinced one of the reasons why it’s so disproportionately high in the UK
        is the active participation by an abnormally high number of people in music compared
        to almost any other country. Organisations like HMS function largely without
        state support and their social impact and importance to the community and
        the country is too often underestimated.”

        Mr Ross and HMS’s three other professionals – chorus master Christopher Hann,
        Tom Horn, orchestra leader and assistant conductor, and Clive Osgood, rehearsal
        pianist and deputy chorus master – all play an “extremely important and valuable
        role in its success”, he added.

        "HASLEMERE Musical Society (HMS) is going from strength to strength
        with leading UK conductor James Ross as its musical director, and hopes are
        high for a full house at the next big concert on March 8th when Dvořák’s Symphony
        No 6 and Bruckner’s Mass No 1 in D Minor will raise the roof at Haslemere Hall.
        “They are both big demanding heavyweight works,” he told The Herald.
        “Bruckner’s mass is almost never done and this might be the only performance in
        the UK this year.”

        It promises to be a packed stage but it still won’t hit the dizzy heights of
        the Commonwealth Festival Orchestra that Ross conducted in Sri Lanka last year
        to mark the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.  More than
        90 musicians joined forces in Colombo’s Nelum Pokuna theatre, including 60
        musicians from The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka and 30 British musicians
        from the Purcell School for Young Musicians in London, Chetham’s School of
        Music in Manchester and the Royal Academy of Music. “I was invited to guest
        conduct and advised them artistically,” he said. “It was an opportunity to
        realise a project I have wanted to do for many years, to bring a large body of
        professional expertise from the UK out for a sustained period of time to work
        together.

        “I took 30 musicians from the UK and six from India in partnership with
        Commonwealth Resounds led by the staff at Purcell School of Music and
        Chetham’s. “The big concert was for all the foreign ministers and wives of the
        heads of state. The heads of state were at a dinner on the same night hosted by
        the Prince of Wales for which I organised musicians. “It was a bit of a
        military operation – there was a list of 100 things that could have gone
        wrong.” Fundraising for the Sunera Foundation helping traumatised Sri Lankan
        children has played an important role in Ross’s concert appearances in Sri
        Lanka and he has helped raise more than £1million through concert-giving.

        Last November, he conducted with English National Ballet in aid of Save The
        Children at the Save The Children Secret Winter Gala at The London Guildhall
        and raised more than £800,000 thanks to the high-profile event. “Not bad for
        one night,” he said.  “I also did musical realisations of The Nutcracker, using
        music from the ballet and other material from film scores adapted by me and the
        electronic composer Tom Middleton. Tom and I are keen to do more work together
        in the future.”

        Back to the present and Ross is full of praise for HMS, which also benefits
        from the expertise of three other professionals chorus master Christopher Hann,
        orchestra leader Tom Horn, and rehearsal pianist and deputy chorus master Clive
        Osgood.

        “Without organisations like HMS there would be no music industry at the
        professional level,” Ross said. “I am an advisor to major record companies and
        major players in the music industry and it is really evident what an important
        dynamic the amateur section is. “Organisations like HMS function largely
        without state support and their social impact and importance to the community
        and the country is too often underestimated.”

        Tickets for the March 8th concert at 7.30pm at Haslemere Hall are £8 to £15, half
        price for under 18s. To book and for more information about the society go to

        "Haslemere Musical Society once again demonstrated the quality and energy
        possible from an amateur musical ensemble during their concert on March 8.
        There was a true sense of celebration and occasion at Haslemere Hall, where the
        orchestra and the chorus, led by conductor James Ross, gathered to perform
        Dvořák’s Symphony No. 6, and Bruckner’s Locus Iste and Mass No. 1 in D Minor. 
        
        The orchestra began the concert as they meant to go on – with plenty of energy
        and ever-building tension. The woodwinds were particularly impressive
        throughout the course of the evening, and overall the orchestra was as strong
        and together as I have ever seen them. But the highlight of the concert came in
        the form of Dvořák’s Scherzo, which incorporates a reeling, rhythmic Czech
        dance called the Furiant, alternating constantly between two beats and three.
        It is complex music that is both challenging to the orchestra and exciting to
        the listener, and the HMS orchestra pulled it off triumphantly. 
        
        The chorus brought in the second half of the concert with Bruckner’s short and
        powerful Locus Iste, which showed off the chorus’s capacity for tight
        harmonies. This was followed by an impressive and dynamic performance of
        Bruckner’s Mass in D Minor. The Credo was particularly well-delivered, with the
        chorus and orchestra working together seamlessly. The Benedictus, an
        unforgiving and complicated movement for vocalists, with high and low notes
        alternating in rapid succession, was invigorating and exciting. For an amateur
        chorus, these singers were able to deliver an impressive performance of music
        that all too few choral groups ever encounter. If the chorus could tighten
        their diction and synchronise their beginning and ending consonants a bit
        better, they could come close to perfection.
        
        Four excellent soloists - Eleanor Rastall, Joanna Bywater, Mark Evans and
        Edward Roberts – enhanced the evening further, but one couldn’t help feeling
        that they were not used to their greatest advantage. Admittedly, Bruckner makes
        less use of his soloists than many other composers, but it was a shame that all
        four were placed to the side, directly behind the brass sections, rather in the
        centre, where they could have been better heard. 
        
        Afterwards I overheard it said that it was the best concert the Haslemere
        Musical Society has ever had. Having only attended a handful myself, I couldn’t
        possibly confirm or deny, but their performance went a long way toward
        convincing me. Haslemere is extremely fortunately to have such a talented and
        dedicated musical society, and I think we can expect them to get better and
        better. 
        
        The concert was dedicated to the memory of Colin Gilbert, a cellist who played
        in the orchestra for over 35 years and sadly passed away in December 2013.
