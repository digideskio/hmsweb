      "The season 2013 – 2014 embraced the 90th anniversary of the Haslemere Musical
      Society and began with the orchestral concert in October in St Christopher’s
      Church, Weyhill.   Our reviewer commended the performance of an ambitious
      programme of music and mentioned particularly the oboe playing of David
      Farnworth partnered by some excellent flute, clarinet and horn playing in both
      Fauré’s Pelléas et Mélisande and Ravel’s Le Tombeau de Couperin. In the second
      half of the evening the orchestra performed Brahms’s Serenade No 1 which opened
      with some splendid horn playing by Roger Doulton.  The Church was almost full
      and the audience was treated to a splendid evening of music.
      
      December 2013 was memorable for celebrating the 90th Anniversary of the Society
      with the Beethoven Eroica Symphony.  It was played with piano support at the
      first HMS concert in 1923 but in 2013 the full orchestra played it with great
      aplomb. The choir also excelled itself in the Vivaldi Gloria and the Bach
      Wachet Auf, the latter conducted by the chorus master, Christopher Hann.
      
      The March 2014 concert began with the orchestra showing great energy in
      Dvoṙắk’s Symphony No 6, the highlight being the Scherzo, which the audience
      found very exciting. The chorus performed well in Bruckner’s Locus Iste and
      gave an impressive rendering in Bruckner’s Mass in D Minor.  In the Mass the
      choir was well supported by four local soloists, Eleanor Rastall, Joanna
      Bywater, Mark Evans and Edward Roberts.
      
      The final concert of the season was on 10th May and featured a splendidly-
      mixed programme ranging from light-hearted to religious and royal grandeur.
      The concert began with Brahms’s Academic Festival Overture with the chorus
      battling to be heard above the orchestra in the finale.  The programme included
      several small choral works, Bach’s Ave Maria, Franck’s Psalm 150 and Panis
      Angelicus, Mozart’s Ave Verum Corpus and three of the Coronation Anthems by
      Handel but the highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the orchestra leader
      Tom Horn playing in Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy."

      Other HMS events were the ‘Come and Sing’ on 1st February in St Christopher’s
      Church when Christopher Hann rehearsed a chorus of about one hundred singers in
      Handel’s Zadok the Priest and Parry’s I Was Glad and Blest Pair of Sirens. The
      orchestra joined the chorus for the final run through which was enjoyed by a
      small audience.  A rousing rendering of Parry’s Jerusalem ended a very
      successful afternoon.  
      
      Then in May there was the ‘Find Your Voice’ evening when interested singers
      were invited to try out their voices for free.  This was a most enjoyable
      occasion again in St Christopher’s Church and again conducted by Christopher
      Hann.  
      
      On June 21st in remarkably fine weather guests were treated to a delightful
      evening in the garden of Thea Jourdan and David Lord.  While enjoying a
      delicious buffet supper, diners listened to music played by Joe Yeadon’s
      Godalming College Jazz Band.
      
      The summer would not be complete without the Summer Sessions in June organised
      by the orchestra as sight-reading sessions for instrumentalists.  The chorus
      was privileged to join in the first two sessions. The Society has made a great
      start to the 2014 – 2015 Season.  The Chorus is larger than it has ever been
      and the orchestra is excelling itself. "
