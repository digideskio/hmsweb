    description: "HMS members are invited to be part of the UK's largest single week adult choral course! 

                  This hugely successful summer course is the largest single week gathering of
                  adult choral singers in the country. Its blend of large chorus and chamber
                  choir repertoire, excellent choral tutors and mix of singing and social
                  activities make it a very popular course for singers of all abilities and
                  backgrounds.
                  
                  Rehearse and perform choral works (with orchestra) and chamber choir music in the same week.
                  
                  The 2014 South of England Festival Chorus work will be:
                  
                  Elgar's DREAM OF GERONTIUS
                  
                  Some HMS members went along last year (Mendelssohn's ELIJAH) and report that it was well organised.
