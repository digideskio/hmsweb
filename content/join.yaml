   text: "HMS is one of the few societies to have both an orchestra and a choir.
         We are always pleased to welcome new members - both singers and
         instrumentalists. All we ask of our members is that they should be enthusiastic
         and committed.


         New choir members are always welcome (sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses).
         No audition is required. Come along to any rehearsal and meet us all.

         The orchestra is currently expanding and recruiting new high-standard
         musicians. There are currently vacancies for strings, brass, timpanist
         (instrument available); auditions will be required for wind/brass vacancies.
         Other instrumentalists are welcome to inquire about extra playing and
         deputising opportunities.

         Both choir and orchestra rehearse on Monday evenings from 7.30 to 10.00
         in the link:http://www.haslemerehall.co.uk/|Haslemere Hall|,
         between September and May. There is normally a final rehearsal during the
         afternoon before each concert.

         The society also meets for a number of summer sessions, working
         with invited conductors.

   text: "HMS also run Come and Sing events where society members, family, friends and
            others can join us in learning a new work.

            bold:Find Your Voice| is an attempt to give local people a chance to find out if they
            have a voice and if they can sing. 

            Many people have a singing voice but haven't tried it for years.

            bold:When:       Monday 19 May at 7.45 pm|

            We will introduce you to an evening of coaching under the direction of our
            brilliant choirmaster Chris Hann. The evening will be in two parts:

            bold:Part 1 - How to warm up your voice and how the voice works|

            bold:Part 2 - Putting it into practice|

            Using very simple repertoire (that will not require the ability to read music)
            we will explore how we put the vocal exercises into practice when singing a
            piece of music.  We will also begin to explore singing in parts.

            Finally we will offer you a glass of wine and the opportunity to meet other
            like-minded people. 

            To take part in this unique event please contact Joe McDonald, Haslemere
            Musical Society, tel. 01428 645062 or email: marketing@hmsoc.org.uk
