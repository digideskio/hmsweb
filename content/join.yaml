   text: "HMS is one of the few societies to have both an orchestra and a choir.
         We are always pleased to welcome new members - both singers and
         instrumentalists. All we ask of our members is that they should be enthusiastic
         and committed.


         New choir members are always welcome (sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses).
         No audition is required. Come along to any rehearsal and meet us all.

         The orchestra is currently expanding and recruiting new high-standard
         musicians. There are currently vacancies for strings, brass, timpanist
         (instrument available); auditions will be required for wind/brass vacancies.
         Other instrumentalists are welcome to inquire about extra playing and
         deputising opportunities.

         Both choir and orchestra rehearse on Monday evenings from 7.30 to 10.00
         in the link:http://www.haslemerehall.co.uk/|Haslemere Hall|,
         between September and May. There is normally a final rehearsal during the
         afternoon before each concert.

         The society also meets for a number of summer sessions, working
         with invited conductors.

      small charge is made to cover music hire, venue and refreshments. The

   title: Come and Sing
   text: "HMS also run Come and Sing events where society members, family, friends and
          others can join us in learning a new work.

          On 19th May, Haslemere Musical Society ran a Find Your Voice evening for the
          benefit of any people in the Haslemere area who wanted to find out whether the
          noises they make in the bath might be acceptable in a full choir.
          
          St Christopher's Church in the town was host to 65 enthusiastic singers, who
          were put through their paces by HMS chorus master, Chris Hann. \"He taught us
          first about where the voice comes from and how it works best,\" said Paul
          Osborne, who hadn't sung a note for 20 years. \"He made us breathe and stand up
          properly and roll our tongues in strange ways around our mouths. He showed us
          how so many people sing badly and explained why. Then when he'd done this, he
          got us all to sing and we made a fantastic noise. I couldn't believe how
          powerful we sounded.\"
          
          The publicity officer for Haslemere Musical Society, Joe McDonald, was
          delighted with the results of the evening. \"We had 45 singers brand-new to the
          society plus 20 of our own members who came to learn more. We are fortunate in
          having a brilliant young chorus master in Chris Hann who is an inspirational
          teacher. One of my friends described him after the event as Haslemere's answer
          to Gareth Malone.\""
