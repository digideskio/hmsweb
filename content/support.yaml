        text:  "HMS Friends are the vital core of an appreciative and discerning audience,
               and are a sociable group of like-minded music lovers.
    
               Friends are kept in touch with our plans and activities through regular
               newsletters from the Secretary, who is a member of the choir.
    
               A Friends subscription is just £20 per annum, and you will receive our
               newsletter and other relevant communications. We will also include your
               name in our concert programmes and on our website."
