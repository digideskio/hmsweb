        The Haslemere Musical Society’s well-loved ‘Come and Sing’ will, as before,take
        place in the delightful St Christopher’s Church, Weyhill.  After his highly
        successful event in February 2014 we have persuaded Christopher Hann to take
        the baton again (even though he will have moved on and will no longer be the
        Society’s Chorus Master).  The date for 2015 is Saturday 7th February and the
        work to be rehearsed will be choruses from Mozart’s ‘Requiem’.  Local Soprano,
        Sarah Thomas will sing the soprano solos in those passages where a soprano
        soloists sings in addition to the chorus.

        The flyer below contains more details about participating.
